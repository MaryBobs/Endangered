# Endangered

Endangered is an educational web app designed for primary age children. It uses an interactive map to teach children about endangered animals and the threats they face.

This was my first small group project as part of the CodeClan course. The app was built by a team of four using Vue, JS, Express and MongoDB. It allows children to click on a continent to see examples of endangered animals living there. For each animal they are given a fun fact and can answer a multiple choice quiz question. They can choose up to three of their favourite animals and find out what the biggest common threat is to them and what they can do to help.

## Project Brief

### Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

### MVP
A user should be able to:
•	view some educational content on a particular topic
•	be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content
### Example Extensions
•	Use an API to bring in content or a database to store information.
•	Use charts or maps to display your information to the page.
